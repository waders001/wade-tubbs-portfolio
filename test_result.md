# Testing Results - Wade Tubbs Portfolio

## Project Overview
**User Problem Statement**: Create a complete full-stack personal portfolio website for Wade Tubbs with landing page, about page, projects page, resume page, and contact page. Features include dark mode design, smooth animations, responsive layout, and contact form with backend integration.

## Implementation Summary
- âœ… **Backend**: FastAPI server with MongoDB integration
- âœ… **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion
- âœ… **Database**: MongoDB for contact form submissions
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with bottom navigation
- âœ… **Animations**: Smooth transitions and gradient backgrounds
- âœ… **Contact Form**: Full backend integration with success/error handling

## Testing Protocol
When testing is required, follow these steps:

1. **Backend Testing**: Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent to test API endpoints
2. **Frontend Testing**: Ask user permission before testing frontend
3. **Read this file**: Always read and update this file before testing
4. **Minimal Changes**: Take minimum steps when editing this file
